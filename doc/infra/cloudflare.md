# Overview

Cloudflare runs `npm run build` on pushes to all branches. Pushes to non-`main`
branches are hosted in a "preview" environment

# Adoption

Once we're happy with the Cloudflare deploy process â€“ and once its version
is at feature parity with [topology.pi-base.org](http://topology.pi-base.org/) â€“
we can redirect traffic &/or domain records to Cloudflare.
