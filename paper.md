# Statement of need

> Topology is a dense forest of counterexamples. A usable map of the forest is a fine thing.

The preceding quote is paraphrased from Mary Ellen Rudin's review
[@mer:1971] of Counterexamples in Topology [@MR1382863]. This text
became well-known as a convenient handbook of the topological properites
and counter-examples that would have been considered standard to
researchers in general and set-theoretic topology active in its date
of publication (1970).

This book was developed as an outcome of
National Science Foundation REUs (research experiences for undergraduates)
held in Summers 1967 and 1968. The authors and their students worked
diligently to survey the field and provide a comprehensive crosslisting
of over 140 topological spaces and 60 topological properties, summarized
in the General Reference Chart depicted in \autoref{fig:book-chart}.

<!-- # Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->

# Acknowledgements

The π-Base would not be of value to mathematics researchers without its
volunteer community of contributors and reviewers. Particular thanks
are due to Chris Caruvana, Patrick Rabau, and Lynne Yuenglalp for their
support of the project in recent years. Additional thanks are due to
Austin Mohr and Scott Varagona for their prior contributions to early
iterations of the project.

Funding for the π-Base was provided by an internal University of South
Alabama faculty development grant.

The π-Base is dedicated to the memory of our friend and mentor
Gary Gruehange.
